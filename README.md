## Project Overview

Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project! In this project, you will learn how to build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

## Helpful Link For The Project:

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used to analyse image data. You can find more information about their on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network).

Transfer Learning is a Machine Learning method where a model developed for a task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task. It is a popular approach in Deep Learning where pre-trained models are used as the starting point on computer vision and natural language processing tasks given the vast compute and time resources required to develop neural network models on these problems and from the huge jumps in a skill that they provide on related problems.
