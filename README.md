## Project Overview

Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project! In this project, you will learn how to build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used to analyse image data. You can find more information about their on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network)
